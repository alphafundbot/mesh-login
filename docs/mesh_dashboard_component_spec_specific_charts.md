# Mesh Dashboard Component Specification: Specific Chart Types

## Purpose and Usage

This document specifies the design and behavior for specific chart types used within the Mesh Dashboard, building upon the general chart and data visualization element specifications. Each chart type is suited for visualizing different kinds of data to provide clear and insightful representations of mesh operations.

## Bar Chart

### Purpose and Usage

Bar charts are used to compare values across different categories or to show changes over discrete periods. They are effective for displaying rankings, distributions, and trends over time intervals (e.g., daily resource usage, number of events per module).

### Visual Appearance

-   **Bars:** Use a consistent color palette (aligned with the strategist-grade design language). Consider variations in shade or intensity to highlight specific data points or trends. Add subtle border radius to the top corners of bars.
-   **Axes:** Follow the specifications defined in `mesh_dashboard_component_spec_data_viz_elements.md`. Ensure clear labeling and appropriate scaling.
-   **Grid Lines:** Subtle grid lines (following general chart specs) to aid readability without cluttering the visualization.

### Data Mapping

Data should typically be an array of objects, where each object represents a category or time period and contains the values to be visualized.

```
typescript
interface BarChartData {
  category: string; // Or date/time string
  value: number;
  // Add more properties for stacked or grouped bars
}
```
### States

-   **Default:** Standard visual representation of bars.
-   **Hover:** Highlight the hovered bar with a subtle color change or outline. Display a tooltip with detailed information (following tooltip specs).
-   **Active/Selected:** Visually indicate a selected bar if interaction requires it.

### Responsiveness

Bars and labels should scale appropriately with the chart container size. Consider stacking or hiding labels on smaller screens if they become too dense. Implement scrolling for charts with a large number of categories on smaller screens.

### Accessibility

Ensure sufficient color contrast between bars and background. Provide alternative text or data tables for users who cannot perceive visual charts. Ensure keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility for interactive elements (like tooltips).

### Notes for Visual Engagement

-   Animate the bars growing from the base when the chart loads or data updates.
-   Use tooltips to display exact values and additional context on hover.
-   Highlight the highest or lowest value bar with a distinct color or animation.

## Area Chart

### Purpose and Usage

Area charts are used to show the trend of a value over time and emphasize the magnitude of the value. They are effective for visualizing cumulative data, volume over time, or comparing the contribution of different categories to a total over time.

### Visual Appearance

-   **Area:** Use a color palette with transparency to allow overlapping areas to be visible (for stacked area charts). The area should fill the space between the line and the axis. Use subtle gradients within the area for a modern look.
-   **Lines:** Follow the specifications defined in `mesh_dashboard_component_spec_charts_visualizations.md` and `mesh_dashboard_component_spec_data_viz_elements.md`.
-   **Axes:** Follow the specifications defined in `mesh_dashboard_component_spec_data_viz_elements.md`. Ensure clear time-based labeling.

### Data Mapping

Data should typically be an array of objects, where each object represents a point in time and contains the values for one or more series.

```
typescript
interface AreaChartData {
  date: string; // Or timestamp
  value: number;
  // Add more properties for stacked or multiple series
}
```
### States

-   **Default:** Standard visual representation of areas and lines.
-   **Hover:** Display a vertical line across the chart at the hovered time point and show tooltips for all series at that point (following tooltip specs).
-   **Interactive:** Support zooming or time range selection if needed.

### Responsiveness

The chart should scale with the container. Consider simplifying the data displayed or allowing for zooming/panning on smaller screens if the data density is too high.

### Accessibility

Ensure sufficient color contrast between areas, lines, and the background. Use patterns or textures in addition to color for differentiating stacked areas to support users with color vision deficiencies. Provide alternative text or data tables.

### Notes for Visual Engagement

-   Animate the area filling up when the chart loads or data updates.
-   Use subtle animations on hover to highlight the specific time point and data values.
-   Highlight significant peaks or dips in the area with visual markers.

## Other Specific Chart Types (Future Consideration)

Depending on the data and insights we need to convey, we may define specifications for other chart types, such as:

-   **Pie/Donut Charts:** For showing proportions of a whole.
-   **Scatter Plots:** For visualizing relationships between two variables.
-   **Heatmaps:** For displaying data density or relationships across two dimensions.
-   **Network Graphs:** For visualizing connections and relationships between entities.

Each of these would require detailed specifications similar to the Bar and Area charts, aligning with the strategist-grade design language and focusing on usability, responsiveness, accessibility, and visual engagement.
