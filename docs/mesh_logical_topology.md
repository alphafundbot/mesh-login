# Mesh Logical Topology Overview

This document describes the intended logical architecture and interaction patterns of the core mesh modules.

## Key Modules:

-   **Destine-root:** (Python) Central control and orchestration module. Receives high-level strategic directives and translates them into actions across the mesh. Handles critical override triggers and system-wide state validation.
-   **MeshDashboard:** (Node.js/TypeScript) User interface for monitoring, managing, and interacting with the mesh. Provides visualizations, control panels, and access to system data.
-   **Firebase-proxy:** (Node.js/TypeScript) Acts as an intermediary, primarily for securely accessing external APIs (like Gemini) and potentially other backend services that the MeshDashboard or other modules interact with.
-   **Audit-engine:** (Python) Performs automated security, compliance, and operational audits across the mesh. Analyzes logs, configurations, and behavior to identify anomalies or violations.
-   **Autonomous Resource Manager:** (Planned - TypeScript/Node.js) Monitors resource utilization, analyzes needs, and autonomously manages resource allocation and scaling across the mesh infrastructure.
-   **IAMControlPanel:** (Planned - within MeshDashboard) Provides a UI for managing user roles, permissions, and service accounts.

## Interaction Patterns:

-   **Strategist (User) ↔ MeshDashboard:** Direct interaction via web interface. User views data, triggers actions, configures settings, and receives notifications. Access controlled by IAM roles.
-   **MeshDashboard ↔ Backend APIs (via Next.js API routes):** MeshDashboard frontend communicates with backend API routes (e.g., `/api/status`, `/api/financial-data`, `/api/gemini`). These API routes handle data fetching, processing, and interaction with other backend modules or external services. Access controlled at the API route level (authentication, authorization).
-   **Backend APIs ↔ Modules:** Backend API routes call functions or services provided by core backend modules.

    -   API routes might call `firebase-proxy` functions to interact with external APIs.
    -   API routes might interact with the `Audit-engine` to trigger audits or retrieve audit results.
    -   API routes will interact with the `Autonomous Resource Manager` for resource data and controls (planned).
-   **Destine-root ↔ Modules:** Destine-root sends commands or signals to other modules to initiate actions (e.g., trigger audits in `Audit-engine`, potentially adjust parameters in `Autonomous Resource Manager` or future revenue modules). Destine-root receives status updates or alerts from modules.
-   **Audit-engine ↔ Other Modules/Resources:** The Audit-engine reads logs, configurations, or state directly from other modules, databases, or infrastructure components to perform its analysis. It reports findings back, potentially to Destine-root or logging systems.
-   **Autonomous Resource Manager ↔ Infrastructure/Cloud Providers:** The Autonomous Resource Manager interacts with underlying infrastructure or cloud provider APIs (via secure interfaces) to monitor resource usage and enact scaling or allocation changes. It reports resource status and optimization decisions.
-   **Modules ↔ Databases/Data Stores:** Modules access shared data stores (e.g., Firestore, other databases) for configuration, state, logs, and operational data. Access controlled by database security rules and service account permissions.
-   **Modules ↔ External Services:** Modules (primarily via `firebase-proxy` or dedicated integrations) interact with external services (Gemini API, planned financial platforms like Stripe/Metamask, telecommunications services). Access controlled by API keys, service accounts, and secure protocols.

## Security Boundaries and Interaction Points:

-   **API Gateway:** The Next.js API routes effectively act as a gateway for frontend-to-backend communication, enforcing authentication and authorization.
-   **Inter-Module Communication:** Secure channels (e.g., internal APIs with authentication/authorization, message queues with access control) should be used for communication between backend modules.
-   **External Service Integrations:** Dedicated, secure connectors or the `firebase-proxy` with strict credential management and access policies should handle interactions with external services.
-   **Database Access:** Database security rules and principle of least privilege for service accounts accessing data stores are critical.
-   **Container Boundaries:** Containerization provides a basic isolation layer between modules.

This logical topology provides a framework for understanding how the different parts of the mesh are designed to work together. Future improvements will focus on hardening these interaction points and adding new modules to enhance capabilities and revenue generation.
