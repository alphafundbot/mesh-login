# Input and Label Component Specifications

## 1. Purpose and Usage

The Input and Label components are fundamental building blocks for user interaction within the MeshDashboard. They are used together to create form fields, allowing users to enter data and clearly identifying the purpose of each input field.

-   **Input:** Allows users to enter text, numbers, or other data types.
-   **Label:** Provides a descriptive caption for an associated input field, improving usability and accessibility.

They will be used in various contexts, including:
-   Configuration forms
-   Data filtering
-   Search inputs
-   User profile settings
-   IAM management interfaces

## 2. Visual Appearance

The visual design of the Input and Label components will align with the strategist-grade design language, emphasizing cleanliness, clarity, and a modern aesthetic.

### 2.1. Input

-   **Shape:** Rounded corners (consistent with the `Card` component's border-radius).
-   **Borders:** Subtle, consistent border color in the default state. A more prominent accent or primary color border in the focus state. A destructive color border in the error state.
-   **Backgrounds:** Clean, neutral background color (e.g., a subtle variation of the `bg-card` color).
-   **Typography:** Use the defined body text font and size from the typography scale. Placeholder text should be in a muted foreground color.

### 2.2. Label

-   **Typography:** Use the defined font and a slightly bolder weight for clarity. Text color should be consistent with the primary or foreground text color.
-   **Spacing:** Appropriate spacing between the Label and its associated Input field, consistent with the defined spacing system.

## 3. States

The components will have clearly defined visual states to provide feedback to the user.

### 3.1. Input States

-   **Default:** Standard appearance with subtle border.
-   **Focus:** Prominent border color (accent or primary), potentially a subtle glow effect (if aligned with design language).
-   **Disabled:** Reduced opacity and a disabled cursor. Border color may be muted.
-   **Error:** Destructive color border and potentially accompanying error text below the input.

### 3.2. Label States

-   **Default:** Standard appearance.
-   **Disabled:** Reduced opacity when the associated input is disabled.
-   **Error:** Destructive color for the label text when the associated input is in an error state.

## 4. Responsiveness

Input and Label components should be responsive, adjusting their size and layout as needed to fit different screen sizes and container widths. The label should maintain its association with the input field on all screen sizes.

## 5. Accessibility

Adherence to accessibility standards is critical:

-   Labels should be correctly associated with their input fields using `htmlFor` and `id` attributes.
-   Sufficient color contrast for text and borders in all states.
-   Clear focus indicators for keyboard navigation.
-   ARIA attributes for conveying state (e.g., `aria-invalid` for error states).

## 6. Notes for Visual Engagement

-   **Micro-interactions:** Subtle animations on focus (e.g., a smooth border color transition).
-   **Validation Feedback:** Visual cues beyond just a border color change for validation (e.g., a small icon within the input field on validation success or error).
-   **Placeholder Text:** Consider slightly more engaging placeholder text (e.g., context-aware examples).

This specification provides a blueprint for implementing the Input and Label components, ensuring they align with the strategist-grade design language and contribute to a usable and visually appealing MeshDashboard.
