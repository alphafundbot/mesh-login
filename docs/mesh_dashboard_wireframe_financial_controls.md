## Revenue Generation Controls: Omega Intensity

**Placement:** This section or page could be integrated into the existing Dashboard ( `/` ), a dedicated Financials page (e.g., `/financials` ), or within the Resource Management section ( `/resource-management` ), depending on the preferred information architecture. For this wireframe, we'll assume a dedicated section on the main Dashboard page.

### Section Title: Omega Intensity (Non-Custodial Vault Revenue)

**Description:** Controls the aggressiveness and focus of the mesh's autonomous revenue-generating activities related to non-custodial vaults.

### UI Elements:

**1. Omega Intensity Knob (Conceptual Volume Knob)**

*   **Appearance:** A circular knob-like control. Visually prominent and engaging. Could have tick marks and labels indicating intensity levels (e.g., 0 - 100).
*   **Functionality:** Primary control for setting the overall "Omega Intensity" level. Drag or click to adjust the value.
*   **Associated Display:** A large, clear numerical display next to the knob showing the current intensity value (e.g., `75`).
*   **Notes for Visual Design:** Incorporate a futuristic, perhaps glowing or animated effect around the knob. The fill level or color of the knob could visually represent the intensity. Haptic feedback on adjustment could enhance engagement.

**2. Risk Tolerance Slide Bar (Conceptual Slide Bar)**

*   **Appearance:** A horizontal slider with a draggable handle.
*   **Functionality:** Secondary control for fine-tuning a specific aspect of Omega Intensity, such as risk tolerance (e.g., a range from "Conservative" to "Aggressive"). Could be linked to the overall Intensity but allow for independent adjustment within constraints.
*   **Associated Display:** Labels at each end of the slider (e.g., "Low Risk" and "High Risk"). A numerical or descriptive display showing the current risk tolerance setting.
*   **Notes for Visual Design:** The slider track could change color based on the risk level. A subtle animation could accompany the handle as it's dragged.

### Associated Information Display:

*   **Current Intensity Level:** Prominently displayed numerical value from the knob.
*   **Calculated Risk Profile:** Based on the Omega Intensity and Risk Tolerance settings, display a calculated risk level (e.g., "Moderate Risk," "High Risk") using color-coded badges (aligning with `Badge` component specs and strategist-grade color palette).
*   **Projected Revenue Impact:** Provide a visual indication or estimated range of potential revenue impact based on the current settings. This could be a simple text display or a small sparkline chart showing a projected trend (referencing Chart/Visualization specs).
*   **Recent Revenue Generated:** Display a summary of recent revenue generated from non-custodial vaults, potentially with a small trend indicator.
*   **Linked Modules:** List the modules that are directly affected by these controls (e.g., Autonomous Trading Agent, Autonomous Resource Manager).

---

### Integration with Relevant Modules:

*   **Control to Module Communication:** Changes to the Omega Intensity and Risk Tolerance controls in the UI will update a central configuration parameter (likely stored securely).
*   **Module Logic:** Revenue-generating modules (e.g., Autonomous Trading Agent) will read this configuration parameter and adjust their internal logic, algorithms, trading frequency, resource requests, etc., accordingly.
*   **Feedback Loop:** Modules should report back their operational status and performance metrics (aligned with the set intensity) to the dashboard for display (referencing Data Visualization and Table specs).

---

### Notes for Visual Design and Interactivity:

*   **Real-time Feedback:** The associated information displays (Current Intensity, Risk Profile, Projected Revenue) should update in near real-time as the controls are adjusted.
*   **Animated Transitions:** Use subtle animations when controls are adjusted or when associated information updates to create a more dynamic and engaging experience.
*   **Consistent Styling:** Ensure the visual design of the knob, slider, displays, and associated text aligns with the strategist-grade design language (Typography, Color Palette, Spacing, Component Styling specs).
*   **Tooltips and Hover Effects:** Provide informative tooltips on hover for the controls and associated information to explain their function and impact.
*   **Integration with AI Visualization:** Consider how the Omega Intensity setting might influence or be influenced by AI-generated insights displayed elsewhere on the dashboard.
