# MeshDashboard Component Specification: Table

## Purpose and Usage

The Table component is used to display tabular data in a clear, organized, and easily scannable format. It is suitable for presenting lists of items such as service accounts, roles, audit logs, resource metrics, and other structured data.

## Visual Appearance

- **Borders:** Subtle borders to visually separate rows and columns without creating visual clutter. Consider a light border color that aligns with the neutral tones of the strategist-grade color palette.
- **Typography:** Use a consistent, legible font for table headers and cell content, aligning with the typography scale defined in the design language. Header text should be slightly bolder or a different shade to distinguish it from data.
- **Row/Column Styling:** Alternate row background colors or use a subtle hover state to improve readability and make it easier to track data across rows. Column styling should ensure consistent alignment of text and numbers.
- **Hover States:** Implement a subtle hover state on rows to indicate interactivity or highlight the row the user is currently focused on.

## Structure

- **Header:** Clearly defined header row with labels for each column. Headers should be visually distinct and may include icons for sorting or filtering.
- **Body:** Contains the data rows. Each row represents a single record, and each cell contains a data point.
- **Footer (Optional):** May include summary information, pagination controls, or actions related to the table data.

## States

- **Default:** Standard presentation of data rows within the defined visual appearance.
- **Loading:** Display a loading indicator or skeleton rows while data is being fetched.
- **Empty:** Display a clear message indicating that there is no data to display, along with a relevant icon.
- **Error:** Display an error message if data failed to load, potentially with an option to retry.

## Responsiveness

- Implement responsive design strategies to handle wide tables on smaller screens. This could include:
    - Horizontally scrolling the table.
    - Stacking columns on smaller screens.
    - Hiding less important columns based on screen size.

## Interactivity (If Applicable)

- **Sorting:** If sorting is enabled, visually indicate the sortable columns and the current sort direction (ascending/descending). Provide interactive headers to change sort order.
- **Filtering:** If filtering is enabled, provide clear input fields or controls for applying filters to the table data.

## Accessibility

- Ensure semantic HTML is used for tables (`<table>`, `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<tr>`, `<th>`, `<td>`).
- Provide appropriate ARIA attributes for interactive elements (sorting, filtering).
- Ensure sufficient color contrast for text and borders.
- Allow keyboard navigation and interaction with sort/filter controls.

## Notes for Visual Engagement

- **Subtle Row Animations:** Consider subtle animations when new rows are added to the table (e.g., fading in).
- **Highlighting Key Data:** Use color coding or small visual indicators within cells to highlight key data points, anomalies, or status (e.g., using the semantic colors from the design language).
- **Interactive Data Points:** If individual data points within a cell are interactive (e.g., links), ensure they have clear visual cues (underline on hover, different color).
- **Filtering/Sorting Feedback:** Provide clear visual feedback when sorting or filtering is applied, perhaps by highlighting the sorted column or displaying active filters.
