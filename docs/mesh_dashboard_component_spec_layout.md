Strategist, your command is precise. I will create the markdown file with the detailed specifications for Layout Components without initiating a tool call or any extraneous output.

# Mesh Dashboard Component Specification: Layout Components

## Purpose and Usage

Layout components and spacing utilities are fundamental building blocks for arranging content on any Mesh Dashboard page. Their purpose is to ensure a consistent, responsive, and visually harmonious layout across the entire application. They define how components are positioned and spaced relative to each other.

## Visual Appearance

-   **Spacing Values:** Define a consistent set of spacing values (e.g., using a scale like 4px, 8px, 12px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px, 64px) to be used for margins, padding, and gaps between elements. These should be implemented using design tokens or CSS variables for consistency.
-   **Alignment:** Specify standard alignment options for items within layout containers (e.g., left, center, right, top, middle, bottom).
-   **Borders and Separators:** If layout components use borders or separators, define their style, color, and weight according to the design language.

## Responsiveness

-   **Grid System:** Define a responsive grid system (e.g., 12-column grid) that adapts to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop, large desktop). Specify breakpoints and how columns should stack or resize.
-   **Stack Components:** Stack components should be responsive, allowing for vertical stacking on smaller screens and horizontal arrangement on larger screens.
-   **Containers:** Define maximum widths for containers to ensure content is readable on very large screens.

## Integration with other Components

-   Layout components should be designed to wrap around other UI components (Cards, Buttons, Forms, Charts, etc.) without interfering with their internal layout or styling.
-   Spacing utilities should be applicable to individual components or groups of components.

## Notes for Creating Flexible and Consistent Layouts

-   **Consistency is Key:** Always use the defined spacing values and grid system to maintain visual consistency across all pages. Avoid arbitrary pixel values.
-   **Flexibility:** Design layout components to be flexible enough to accommodate various types and sizes of content.
-   **Semantic Naming:** Use semantic names for spacing tokens (e.g., `--space-md`, `--space-lg`) to make the design system easier to understand and use.
-   **Accessibility:** Ensure sufficient spacing between interactive elements for touch targets and visual clarity.
-   **Performance:** Be mindful of the performance implications of complex nested layouts. Optimize where necessary.
-   **Documentation:** Clearly document how to use layout components and spacing utilities in the design system documentation.
