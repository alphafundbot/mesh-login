# Snapshots Page Wireframe

## Page Title: Snapshots

## Overall Layout:

The page will primarily consist of a main content area. Depending on screen size, a sidebar or modal may be used for displaying snapshot details or controls.

## Key Sections:

1.  **Snapshot List/Table:**
    *   Purpose: To display a list of available system snapshots.
    *   Content Arrangement: A table or a list format, showing key information for each snapshot.
    *   Columns/Items: Snapshot ID, Creation Timestamp, Description, Size, Status (e.g., Available, Creating, Error), Actions (View Details, Diff, Restore - with role-based access control).

2.  **Snapshot Details Panel (Sidebar or Modal):**
    *   Purpose: To display detailed information about a selected snapshot.
    *   Content Arrangement: Organized sections within a sidebar or modal.
    *   Sections: Overview (ID, Timestamp, Description, Status, Size), Related Resources (List of resources included in the snapshot), Activity Logs (Logs related to snapshot creation or management), Metadata.

3.  **Snapshot Creation/Management Controls:**
    *   Purpose: To provide controls for creating new snapshots and managing existing ones.
    *   Content Arrangement: Buttons or forms placed strategically on the page (e.g., a "Create Snapshot" button at the top, action buttons within the snapshot list).
    *   Controls: "Create Snapshot" Button (opens a modal/form for defining snapshot parameters), Action Buttons (View Details, Diff, Restore, Delete - within the list/table items, with role-based access control).

## Content Arrangement within Sections:

*   Use **Cards** to group related information within the details panel (e.g., Overview Card, Related Resources Card).
*   Use a **Table** for the main snapshot list and potentially for displaying lists of related resources or activity logs within the details panel.
*   Use **Forms** (with **Input**, **Label**, **Button**, **Select**, **Checkbox**) for creating new snapshots or editing snapshot properties (if applicable).
*   Use **Lists** for displaying simple lists of items within the details panel.

## Integration of Components:

*   The main layout will utilize **Layout Components** (Grid, Stack, Container) for structure and responsiveness.
*   **Table** components will be used for displaying snapshot lists and related data.
*   **Button** components will be used for actions (Create Snapshot, View Details, Diff, Restore, Delete).
*   **Modal** or **Sidebar** components will be used for the Snapshot Details Panel and Snapshot Creation Form.
*   **Input**, **Label**, **Select**, **Checkbox**, **Textarea** will be used within forms.
*   **Feedback Components** (Toasts, Dialogs, Loaders) will provide feedback on snapshot operations (creation progress, errors, success).

## Visualization of Snapshot History or Differences:

*   Integrate concepts from the **Snapshot Diff** view (referencing the separate wireframe/spec). A button within the snapshot list could link to or trigger a visualization comparing the selected snapshot to a previous one.
*   Consider a simple timeline visualization within the Snapshot List section to show the history of snapshots.
*   If possible, visualize the size or content changes between snapshots.

## Notes for Visual Design and Interactivity:

*   Apply the **strategist-grade design language** (typography, colors, spacing, iconography) consistently across all components.
*   Use **Cards** with refined styling and subtle hover effects for list items if not using a full table.
*   Ensure the **Table** is visually clean, easy to scan, and responsive. Highlight status (Available, Error) with clear visual indicators (e.g., color-coded badges).
*   Design the **Snapshot Details Panel** to be clear and organized, with a strong visual hierarchy.
*   Implement **Role-Based Access Control** visually by disabling or hiding action buttons that the current user does not have permission to use.
*   Incorporate **Visual Engagement** through subtle animations on list updates, loading states, and form submissions.
*   For the Diff visualization, aim for a clear and intuitive presentation of changes between snapshots.
*   Ensure all interactive elements have clear hover, focus, and active states.
*   Provide clear validation feedback on the Snapshot Creation form using the **Form Validation** specifications.
