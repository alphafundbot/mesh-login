## Page Title
Memory Map

## Key Sections

### Visualization Area
- Dominant central area for the interactive memory map visualization.
- Represents nodes (components, data points, concepts) and connections (relationships, dependencies, data flow).
- Allows panning, zooming, and potential node selection.

### Controls/Filters
- Sidebar or top panel containing controls to filter the visualization.
- Filter options could include:
    - Node types (e.g., Module, Data Source, AI Model, Resource)
    - Connection types (e.g., Data Flow, Dependency, Security Relationship)
    - Time range
    - Search functionality for nodes/connections

### Node/Connection Details Panel
- Sidebar or bottom panel that appears when a node or connection is selected in the visualization area.
- Displays detailed information about the selected element.
- Content arrangement within panel:
    - Card for overview/summary of the node/connection.
    - Lists or tables for properties, attributes, or related information.
    - Links to relevant detail pages (e.g., Resource Details, Module Details).

## Content Arrangement
- The main content is the interactive visualization area, taking up the majority of the screen space.
- Controls/Filters are positioned in a fixed sidebar on the left or a collapseable panel at the top.
- The Node/Connection Details Panel is positioned as a secondary sidebar on the right or a collapseable panel at the bottom, appearing on interaction with the visualization.

## Integration of Components
- Interactive visualization component (custom or library-based).
- Filter controls using Input, Select, Checkbox components.
- Detail display using Card, List, Table, Typography components.
- Buttons for applying filters, resetting view, etc.

## Visualization of Relationships and Connections
- Nodes represented by distinct shapes or icons based on type.
- Connections represented by lines or arrows, potentially color-coded or styled based on type or strength.
- Visual cues for node status or anomalies (e.g., color change, pulsing effect).
- Option to highlight paths or clusters of nodes.

## Notes for Visual Design and Interactivity
- Implement smooth transitions and animations for panning, zooming, and filtering to make the interaction feel fluid and engaging.
- Use distinct visual treatments for different node and connection types to improve readability.
- Incorporate subtle hover effects on nodes and connections to indicate interactivity.
- Design clear visual indicators for selected nodes/connections.
- Explore using physics-based layouts for the visualization to create a dynamic and visually appealing structure.
- Ensure the visualization remains performant even with a large number of nodes and connections.
- Design the detail panel to be visually consistent with other detail views and provide quick access to relevant information.
