# Mesh Dashboard Component Specification: Navigation Elements

## Purpose and Usage

Navigation elements (Sidebar, Tabs, Breadcrumbs) are critical for enabling users to move through the Mesh Dashboard efficiently and understand their current location within the application's information architecture. They should be intuitive, visually clear, and consistent across the platform.

## Visual Appearance

- **Colors:**
  - Backgrounds: Align with the strategist-grade color palette's neutral or subtle accent tones. Active/hover states should use primary or accent colors with appropriate contrast.
  - Typography: Use primary or neutral text colors for labels. Active states should use a contrasting color for emphasis.
  - Icons: Use icons that align with the overall iconography style. Default state icons should be a neutral or muted color, changing to primary or accent on hover/active.
- **Typography:** Use the designated font family and scale for navigation labels. Font size should be legible and consistent.
- **Spacing:** Consistent padding and margins around navigation items, groups, and between elements. Use a defined spacing system (e.g., based on multiples of a base unit).
- **Borders/Separators:** Subtle borders or dividers to visually separate navigation groups or items where necessary, aligning with the border styling defined in the design language.
- **Active/Inactive states:** Clearly distinguishable visual styles for active and inactive navigation items (e.g., background color, text color, icon color, a left/right border indicator).

## Structure

- **Sidebar:**
  - Hierarchical structure with main menu items and potential sub-menu items (e.g., for Snapshots).
  - Grouping of related navigation items with clear labels (e.g., Analysis, System, Meta).
  - Persistent user information and logout at the bottom (as per current design, refined visually).
- **Tabs:**
  - Used for navigating between different views or sub-sections within a main page.
  - Visually distinct active tab with an underline or background color change.
- **Breadcrumbs:**
  - Display the user's current path within the application hierarchy.
  - Text links for parent pages, with the current page as plain text.
  - Use separators (e.g., ">" or "/") with appropriate spacing.

## States

- **Sidebar:**
  - **Expanded:** Default state, showing icons and labels.
  - **Collapsed:** Compact state, showing only icons, potentially with tooltips on hover for labels. Transition should be smooth.
- **Tabs:**
  - **Active:** Clearly highlighted to indicate the current view.
  - **Inactive:** Standard appearance, visually distinct from the active state.
- **All Navigation Items (Sidebar, Tabs, Breadcrumbs links):**
  - **Default:** Standard visual appearance.
  - **Hover:** Subtle visual change to indicate interactivity (background color, text color, icon color, underline for links).
  - **Active:** Distinct visual style to indicate the current page or section.
  - **Disabled:** Dimmed appearance with no interactivity.

## Responsiveness

- **Sidebar:** Should adapt to smaller screen sizes. This might involve collapsing the sidebar by default on mobile, or transitioning to a different navigation pattern (e.g., a hamburger menu or a bottom navigation bar) for very small screens.
- **Tabs:** Should handle overflow on smaller screens, potentially becoming scrollable or transitioning to a different display format (e.g., a dropdown).
- **Breadcrumbs:** Should truncate or wrap long paths on smaller screens to prevent layout issues.

## Accessibility

- Ensure sufficient color contrast for text and icons in all states.
- Provide clear focus indicators for keyboard navigation.
- Use appropriate ARIA attributes for semantic meaning and screen reader compatibility.
- Ensure clickable areas are large enough for easy interaction on touch devices.

## Notes for Visual Engagement

- **Subtle Animations:** Implement subtle animations on hover for navigation items (e.g., slight background color transition, icon scale).
- **Active State Transition:** Smooth transition when changing active navigation items.
- **Sidebar Collapse/Expand Animation:** A smooth and visually pleasing animation when the sidebar collapses or expands.
- **Notification Badges:** Visually engaging badges on navigation items to indicate pending notifications or updates (e.g., small, animated dot or count).
- **Contextual Highlighting:** Consider subtly highlighting navigation items related to ongoing critical events or AI activity.
