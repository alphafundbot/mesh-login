# Wireframe: Resource Management Page

## Page Title and Introduction

**Page Title:** Resource Management

**Introduction:** A brief description of the page's purpose - to provide oversight and control of mesh resources.

## Key Sections

- **Resource Overview:** A section providing high-level metrics and status of mesh resources.
- **Resource Utilization Charts:** Visual representations of resource usage over time.
- **Resource List:** A detailed list of individual resources with key information.
- **Allocation Controls:** Tools and interfaces for adjusting resource allocations and scaling.

## Content Arrangement within Sections

### Resource Overview
- Use **Cards** to display key metrics like:
    - Total CPU Usage (%)
    - Total Memory Usage (%)
    - Network Throughput (Mbps)
    - Number of Active Containers/Nodes
    - Estimated Monthly Cost
- A small text area for high-level status or AI-driven summary of resource health.

### Resource Utilization Charts
- A primary area for **Charts** visualizing:
    - CPU Utilization over time (Line Chart)
    - Memory Utilization over time (Line Chart)
    - Network Traffic (Area Chart)
    - Resource Allocation vs. Actual Usage (Bar Chart)
- Consider smaller charts or sparklines within cards in the Resource Overview section.

### Resource List
- Use a **Table** to list individual resources (e.g., containers, VMs, databases).
- Columns in the table might include:
    - Resource Name/ID
    - Type
    - Current Status (Badge)
    - CPU Usage (%)
    - Memory Usage (%)
    - Network In/Out
    - Assigned Role/Module
    - Actions (e.g., View Details, Scale, Restart - **Buttons**)

### Allocation Controls
- May use **Cards** or distinct sections for different types of controls.
- Forms (using **Input** and **Label** components) for manual allocation adjustments.
- **Buttons** for triggering automated scaling or optimization recommendations from the Autonomous Resource Manager.
- Visualizations (potentially mini-charts or indicators within forms) showing the impact of allocation changes.

## Integration of Components

- **Card:** Used extensively to group related information and metrics in the Overview and Allocation Controls sections.
- **Button:** Used for actions within the Resource List table and the Allocation Controls section (e.g., "Scale Up," "Allocate," "View Logs").
- **Table:** The primary component for displaying the list of individual resources.
- **Input/Label:** Used within forms in the Allocation Controls section for manual adjustments.
- **Charts:** Dedicated area for various types of charts visualizing resource utilization.
- **Badge:** Used within the Resource List table to indicate resource status.

## Visualization of Resource Metrics and Optimization Opportunities

- Color-coding in charts and tables to highlight resource hotspots or underutilization.
- Overlay AI-generated recommendations or forecasts directly onto utilization charts.
- Dedicated section or card displaying optimization opportunities identified by the Autonomous Resource Manager, with a clear call to action (Button to apply).
- Visual indicators (e.g., icons, progress bars within table rows) showing the "health" or efficiency of individual resources.

## Controls for Managing Resources

- Clearly labeled **Buttons** for key actions (scaling up/down, reallocating, restarting).
- Confirmation dialogs (using Dialog component) for potentially disruptive actions.
- Visual feedback (loading states on buttons, progress bars) for ongoing operations.
- Integration with the Autonomous Resource Manager module to trigger automated actions or apply AI recommendations.

## Notes for Visual Design and Interactivity

- Real-time or near real-time updates for charts and metrics to give a sense of live monitoring.
- Subtle animations for data points changing in charts or rows updating in the table.
- Interactive charts allowing users to zoom, pan, or hover for detailed data.
- Visual cues (e.g., pulsating indicators) for resources requiring immediate attention or offering significant optimization potential.
- A clean, data-focused aesthetic with clear typography and strategic use of color to highlight status and trends.
