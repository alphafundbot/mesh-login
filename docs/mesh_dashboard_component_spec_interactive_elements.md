# Mesh Dashboard Component Specification: Interactive Elements

## Purpose and Usage

This document specifies the design and behavior of interactive UI elements within the Mesh Dashboard, including Date Pickers, Sliders, Toggles, Steppers, and any other interactive controls used for user input or system configuration. These components facilitate user interaction and control over mesh parameters and data visualization.

## Visual Appearance

- **Colors:** Utilize the strategist-grade color palette for component states (default, hover, focus, active, disabled, error). Primary and accent colors will indicate active or selected states. Neutral colors will be used for borders, backgrounds, and text in default or disabled states. Semantic colors will be used for error or warning states.
- **Typography:** Labels and associated text will adhere to the strategist-grade typography scale. Font weights and sizes will be consistent with their role (e.g., labels, values).
- **Spacing:** Consistent internal padding and external margins will be applied to interactive elements to ensure visual balance and clear separation from other components. Spacing will align with the defined spacing scale.
- **States:** Visual styling will clearly differentiate component states (Default, Hover, Focus, Disabled, Active, Selected, Error). This includes changes in borders, backgrounds, text color, and subtle visual cues.

## States

- **Default:** Standard visual appearance.
- **Hover:** Subtle visual change when the user's cursor is over the element (e.g., slight background color change, border highlight).
- **Focus:** Clear visual indicator when the element is focused (e.g., distinct outline or border style), important for keyboard navigation and accessibility.
- **Disabled:** Visually grayed out or faded, indicating the element is not interactive. Cursor changes to indicate disabled state.
- **Active / Selected:** Visual styling clearly indicates that the element is currently active (e.g., Toggle is on) or selected (e.g., Radio Button is checked, Select option is chosen).
- **Error:** Visual styling (e.g., red border, error icon, red text for associated message) clearly indicates invalid input or an error state.

## Responsiveness

Interactive elements will be designed to be responsive and function correctly across different screen sizes. This may involve:
- Adjusting size and padding for smaller screens.
- Ensuring touch targets are large enough on mobile devices.
- Rethinking layout or presentation for complex elements like Date Pickers on small screens (e.g., modal or full-screen view).

## Accessibility

All interactive elements will adhere to accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.1 AA or higher):
- Keyboard navigability and focus indicators.
- Appropriate ARIA attributes and roles.
- Sufficient color contrast for all states.
- Clear and concise labels associated with input fields.
- Support for screen readers and other assistive technologies.

## Integration with Forms and Data

Interactive elements will seamlessly integrate with form components and data binding:
- Clear association between labels and their corresponding input fields.
- Standardized methods for handling user input and updating data.
- Integration with form validation logic to display error states and messages.

## Notes for Visual Engagement

- **Subtle Animations:** Incorporate subtle animations on state changes (e.g., toggle switch animation, smooth transition on slider thumb movement, fade-in for Date Picker).
- **Clear Visual Indicators:** Use clear visual cues (icons, color changes, borders) to indicate validation status (e.g., checkmark for valid input, error icon for invalid input).
- **Tooltips:** Provide informative tooltips on hover for complex or less intuitive interactive elements.
- **Visual Feedback:** Offer immediate visual feedback upon user interaction (e.g., button press effect, selection highlight).
