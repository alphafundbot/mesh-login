- Introduction: Overview of historical mesh signals and trends.

## Key Sections
- **Signal Feed/Table:** Displays a list of historical signals.
- **Filters:** Controls for filtering signals by type, time range, source, etc.
- **Signal Details Panel:** Displays detailed information about a selected signal.
- **Visualization of Signal Trends:** Charts or graphs showing signal frequency, severity, or other trends over time.

## Content Arrangement within Sections
- **Signal Feed/Table:**
    - Main area, likely using the Table component.
    - Columns for signal timestamp, type, source, severity, summary.
    - Clickable rows to open Signal Details Panel.
- **Filters:**
    - Located above or to the side of the Signal Feed/Table.
    - Using Input, Select, and Button components for filter controls.
- **Signal Details Panel:**
    - Appears on selection of a signal from the table.
    - Could be a sidebar panel or a modal.
    - Displays detailed signal payload, context, and related actions.
- **Visualization of Signal Trends:**
    - Could be a separate section or integrated near the filters.
    - Using Chart components (e.g., line chart for frequency over time, bar chart for severity distribution).

## Integration of Components
- Table component for the main signal list.
- Input, Select, and Button components for filters and interactions.
- Chart components for visualizing trends.
- Card component to group sections.
- Navigation elements (Sidebar, Breadcrumbs) for overall context.

## Visualization of Signal Patterns or Anomalies
- Highlight critical signals in the table (e.g., color coding rows or adding icons).
- Visual cues in charts to indicate periods of high anomaly frequency.
- Potentially a small sparkline within table rows showing recent activity for that signal type.

## Notes for Visual Design and Interactivity
- Subtle animations when new signals load or filters are applied.
- Interactive filtering that immediately updates the table and charts.
- Clear visual distinction between different signal types or severities.
- Hover effects on table rows and chart elements to reveal more information (tooltips).
- A clear visual flow from the signal list to the details panel.
