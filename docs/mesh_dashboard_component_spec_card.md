# MeshDashboard Component Specification: Card

## Purpose and Usage

The Card component is a fundamental building block for organizing and presenting information consistently throughout the MeshDashboard. It is used to visually group related content, such as metrics, data visualizations, lists, and controls. Cards provide a clear visual separation between different sections of content on a page.

## Visual Appearance

Based on the strategist-grade design language:

- **Shape:** Rounded corners with a moderate radius (e.g., 8px or 12px) to convey a modern and slightly softer aesthetic while maintaining a structured feel.
- **Borders:** A subtle, thin border (e.g., 1px solid) using a color from the neutral or border palette to provide definition without being visually heavy. The border color may change on hover or active states.
- **Shadows:** A distinct but not overly heavy box shadow to give the card a sense of depth and lift off the background. The shadow should use a color from the shadow palette and have a moderate blur and offset. The shadow may become more pronounced on hover.
- **Backgrounds:** Primarily uses a background color from the neutral or card background palette. Variations with subtle gradients or textured backgrounds from the design language might be introduced for specific types of cards (e.g., critical alerts, key performance indicators).
- **Internal Spacing:** Consistent internal padding (e.g., 16px or 24px) within the CardHeader, CardContent, and CardFooter to create visual breathing room and separate content from the card edges.

## States

- **Default:** Standard visual appearance as defined above.
- **Hover:** When the user hovers over an interactive card:
    - The box shadow becomes slightly more pronounced.
    - The border color may subtly change or gain a highlight effect.
    - A subtle background color change or overlay might occur.
- **Active (Pressed):** When the user clicks or activates an interactive card:
    - The card might slightly depress or have a more prominent border/shadow change to indicate the active state.

## Content Structure

The Card component provides distinct areas for organizing content:

- **CardHeader:** Typically contains the card title, description, and potentially icons or action buttons related to the card's content. Uses consistent top and bottom padding.
- **CardContent:** The main area for displaying data, visualizations, lists, forms, or other primary content. Uses consistent padding.
- **CardFooter:** Located at the bottom, typically used for action buttons, secondary information, or timestamps. Uses consistent top and bottom padding, often with a top border to separate it from the content.

## Responsiveness

The Card component itself should be fluid and adapt to the width of its container. Internal content (typography, images, visualizations) within the Card should also be designed to be responsive and maintain readability and usability on different screen sizes. Padding may be adjusted based on breakpoints.

## Accessibility

- Ensure sufficient color contrast between the card background, border, shadow, and content (text, icons).
- If the card is interactive, ensure it has appropriate ARIA attributes and is keyboard navigable.
- Maintain a logical reading order for content within the card.

## Notes for Visual Engagement

- Consider subtle animations on data updates within the card content (e.g., pulsing indicators, smooth transitions in charts).
- Micro-interactions on hover over interactive elements within the card (e.g., icons, buttons).
- Using color strategically within the card content (e.g., semantic colors for status) to draw attention to key information.
- Exploring subtle background animations or particle effects for specific high-priority or visually important cards (use sparingly).
