# User Profile Page Wireframe

## Page Title
User Profile: [User Name]

## Key Sections

### Account Information
- Card component for grouping
- Displays user's name, email, unique ID.
- Placeholder for avatar or profile picture.
- Option to edit basic information (Name).

### Role and Permissions
- Card component for grouping
- Displays assigned role(s).
- Section showing permissions associated with the role(s) (can use Table or List component).
- Notes: This section should be read-only for most users, editable only by users with specific IAM management permissions.

### Activity History
- Card component for grouping
- Table component to display a list of recent user activities (e.g., logins, actions taken).
- Columns could include Timestamp, Action, Affected Resource, Status.
- Option to filter or search activity history (using Input and Button components).
- Visualization: Potentially a simple chart showing activity volume over time.

### Settings
- Card component for grouping
- Sections for various user settings (e.g., Notification Preferences, Theme Selection).
- Uses Form elements (Checkboxes, Radio Buttons, Selects, Switches).
- Button to save changes.
- Secure section for changing password (requires current password, new password, confirmation - with appropriate validation and security measures).

## Content Arrangement within Sections
- Each key section is a distinct area within the main content layout.
- Cards are used to visually group related information within sections.
- Forms are used for editable information and settings.
- Tables are used for displaying lists of data like activity history or permissions.
- Layout components (Grid, Stack) are used to arrange these elements within the page and ensure responsiveness.

## Integration of Components
- Card, CardHeader, CardContent, CardTitle components for structuring sections.
- Input, Label, Checkbox, Radio Button, Select, Textarea components for forms.
- Button components for actions (Edit, Save, Change Password, Filter).
- Table component for activity history and permissions display.
- Typography and Spacing utilities from the design language applied throughout.

## Visualization of User Activity Patterns
- A small chart (e.g., Bar Chart or Line Chart) within the Activity History card showing activity count per day or week.
- Could highlight peak activity times.

## Controls for Managing Profile
- "Edit Profile" button (might reveal form fields).
- "Save Changes" button (disabled until changes are made).
- "Change Password" button (opens a secure modal or navigates to a dedicated password change form).

## Notes for Visual Design and Interactivity
- Use clear visual hierarchy to distinguish between sections and key information.
- Ensure form interactions are smooth and provide clear validation feedback (referencing Feedback component specs).
- Secure interactions for password changes should be visually reinforced (e.g., padlock icon, strong password indicators).
- Activity history table could have subtle animations for new entries or filtering.
- Role and permissions section should clearly indicate if it's read-only or editable based on the user's IAM permissions.
