# Mesh Dashboard Component Specification: Form Validation and Error Display

## Purpose and Usage

This specification defines the visual design and behavior of form validation and error display within the Mesh Dashboard. Effective validation feedback is crucial for guiding users, preventing data errors, and ensuring a smooth and trustworthy user experience. It should provide clear, timely, and actionable information about the validity of user input.

## Visual Appearance

-   **Error Messages:**
    -   Typography: Use a slightly smaller font size than the main body text.
    -   Color: Use a dedicated `destructive` or `error` color from the strategist-grade color palette (defined in `docs/design_language.md`).
    -   Iconography: Precede the error message with a small, clear error icon (e.g., a warning triangle or an "x" in a circle), using the same `destructive` color.
-   **Highlighting Invalid Fields:**
    -   Border Color: The input field's border should change to the `destructive` color when it is in an error state.
    -   Optional: A subtle, thin outline or glow around the invalid field in the `destructive` color.
-   **Success States:**
    -   Visual Indicator: Optionally, display a small success icon (e.g., a checkmark in a circle) next to valid fields.
    -   Border Color: Optionally, the input field's border could change to a `success` color from the palette.
-   **Helper Text:** Optional helper text providing guidance on input requirements should use a muted or secondary text color.

## Interaction

-   **When Validation Occurs:**
    -   **On Blur:** Validate a field when the user moves focus away from it (after initial interaction).
    -   **On Submit:** Perform a final validation of all fields when the form is submitted.
    -   **On Change (Optional):** For some critical fields or for real-time feedback, validation could occur as the user types, but this should be carefully considered to avoid being overly intrusive.
-   **Real-time Feedback:** Provide immediate visual feedback (e.g., changing border color, displaying/hiding error icons) as validation states change.

## Placement of Error Messages

-   **Below the Input Field:** The most common and recommended placement is directly below the input field to which the error message pertains.
-   **Consistent Spacing:** Maintain consistent spacing between the input field and the error message.

## Responsiveness

-   **Layout Adaptation:** Ensure that error messages and highlighted fields are clearly visible and do not disrupt the form layout on different screen sizes. Error messages should wrap appropriately on smaller screens.
-   **Touch Targets:** Ensure interactive validation feedback elements (if any) have sufficient touch target size on mobile devices.

## Accessibility

-   **ARIA Attributes:** Use appropriate ARIA attributes (e.g., `aria-describedby` to link the error message to the input field, `aria-invalid` to indicate an invalid field) to ensure screen readers announce validation errors.
-   **Color Contrast:** Ensure sufficient color contrast for error text, icons, and highlighted borders against their background.
-   **Keyboard Navigation:** Ensure keyboard users can easily identify and navigate to invalid fields.

## Notes for Visual Engagement

-   **Subtle Animations:** Consider subtle animations on the appearance and disappearance of error messages or the highlighting of invalid fields to draw the user's attention without being distracting (e.g., a quick fade-in).
-   **Clear Visual Hierarchy:** Use color and iconography consistently to create a clear visual hierarchy between different types of feedback (error, success, info).
-   **Progressive Disclosure:** For complex validation rules, consider progressive disclosure of error details to avoid overwhelming the user initially.
