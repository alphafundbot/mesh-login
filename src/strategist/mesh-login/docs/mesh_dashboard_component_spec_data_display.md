# Mesh Dashboard Component Specification: Data Display Elements

## Purpose and Usage

Data Display Elements, such as lists and individual data items within lists or cards, are used to present structured information in a clear, scannable, and visually organized manner. They are fundamental for displaying lists of records, key-value pairs, status updates, and other discrete pieces of information across the Mesh Dashboard.

## Visual Appearance

- **Typography:** Utilize the typography scale defined in `design_language.md` for titles, labels, values, and secondary text within data items. Key values should have a stronger visual weight (bolder font, slightly larger size) to improve scannability.
- **Spacing:** Apply consistent internal padding within data items and consistent spacing between items in a list, adhering to the spacing guidelines in `design_language.md`. Use a clear visual separation between items (e.g., subtle border, alternating background color).
- **Borders:** Use subtle borders to delineate individual items in a list, consistent with the border styles defined in `design_language.md`. Borders should not be overly distracting.
- **Backgrounds:** Utilize background colors from the neutral palette (`design_language.md`) for lists and data items. Consider alternating background colors for rows in a list to improve readability. Semantic colors should be used for highlighting status or critical values within an item.
- **Icons:** Integrate small, relevant icons (aligned with the iconography style in `design_language.md`) alongside data items to provide visual cues and improve understanding.
- **Visual Hierarchy:** Establish a clear visual hierarchy within each data item to guide the user's eye to the most important information (e.g., title/name, key value, status, timestamp).

## States

- **Default:** Standard visual appearance as defined above.
- **Hover:** Apply a subtle visual change on hover to indicate interactivity (e.g., slight background color change, subtle box shadow, border highlight), consistent with the hover states defined for other components.
- **Selected:** Provide a clear visual indicator when a data item is selected (e.g., distinct background color, accent border) for multi-selection or detail view scenarios.

## Responsiveness

Data display elements should adapt gracefully to different screen sizes:
- Lists should adjust their width and potentially stack content within items on smaller screens.
- Key-value pairs within items should adjust their layout (e.g., from side-by-side to stacked) to fit narrower containers.
- Ensure typography remains readable on all devices.

## Accessibility

- Maintain sufficient color contrast between text and background colors for all states, adhering to WCAG guidelines.
- Ensure interactive elements within data items (if any) are keyboard navigable and have clear focus indicators.
- Provide alternative text or ARIA attributes for icons and complex visual cues.
- Ensure semantic HTML structure for lists and data items.

## Integration with Other Components

Data display elements will often be used within `Card` components or alongside `Table` components for displaying detailed information. They should integrate seamlessly with `Button` components, `Badge` components, and potentially `Chart` components for embedded visualizations within lists.

## Notes for Visual Engagement

- **Subtle Animations:** Consider adding subtle entrance animations for new items appearing in a live list or stream to make updates more noticeable and engaging.
- **Highlighting Key Values:** Use color, typography, or small animations to highlight key metrics, status changes, or values that fall outside expected ranges.
- **Interactive Elements:** If appropriate, include small interactive elements within data items (e.g., a mini sparkline chart next to a trend value, clickable icons for actions) to encourage exploration and interaction ("doom scrolling").
- **Progressive Disclosure:** For complex data items, consider initially showing only essential information and allowing users to expand or click to view more details, preventing visual clutter.
- **Visual Feedback on Actions:** Provide clear visual feedback within the data item itself when an action related to that item is performed (e.g., a subtle change in background color or an icon animation).
