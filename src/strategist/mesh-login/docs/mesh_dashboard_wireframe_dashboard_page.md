# Mesh Dashboard Wireframe: Dashboard Page (/)

## Overall Layout

The Mesh Dashboard utilizes a consistent layout across all its pages, designed for strategist efficiency and information access.

- **Persistent Sidebar Navigation:** A collapsible sidebar on the left provides primary navigation to different sections of the mesh (Dashboard, Signal Memory, System Admin, IAM, etc.). This sidebar will always be visible but can be collapsed to an icon-only state to maximize content area.
- **Main Content Area:** The primary area on the right displays the content of the selected page. This area is responsive and adjusts based on screen size and sidebar state.
- **Optional Top Bar:** A minimal top bar might include global actions, notifications, or a search bar (details to be refined).

## Main Content Area (Dashboard Page)

The main content area of the Dashboard page is the central "Strategist HUD," providing an overview of the mesh's critical states, performance, and AI-driven insights. It's structured using a flexible grid system to accommodate various components and adapt to different screen sizes.

- **Header Section:**
    - **Strategist HUD Title:** Prominent title ("Strategist HUD").
    - **Global Status Indicator:** A clear visual indicator (e.g., a prominent badge or icon) showing the overall mesh status (Optimal, Degraded, Critical). This should be highly visible and potentially animated on status changes.
    - **Role Selector/User Info:** Display the current user's name and role, potentially with an interactive element for switching roles (if applicable and authorized).

- **Key Metrics and Insights Section:**
    - **Revenue Metrics:** Card component displaying key financial metrics (Total Revenue, MRR, CLV, etc.), conditionally rendered based on user permissions. These metrics should update with subtle animations on change.
    - **Revenue Chart:** Visualization (Line Chart) showing revenue forecast vs. actuals, also conditionally rendered. The chart should be interactive (tooltips on hover) and visually appealing with updated styling.
    - **Currency Signal Module:** Component displaying currency data with dynamic elements to show fluctuations.

- **Intelligence and Anomaly Section:**
    - **Cross-Domain Intelligence Map:** Radar chart (or an alternative, more engaging visualization) displaying mesh health across domains (Stability, Security, Activity). Anomalies should be visually highlighted with distinct markers or animations.
    - **Visual Integrity Matrix (Integrated or Separate):** Displays system stress, risk trends, and predictive forecasts. This could use a combination of visual elements like progress bars, heatmaps, or custom risk indicators.
    - **Override Momentum/Recent Anomalies:** A section highlighting recent overrides or significant anomalies with visual emphasis and potentially direct links to detailed logs or analysis.

- **Operational Streams and Audits Section:**
    - **OMEGA PROTOCOL Epoch Stream:** Live stream of epoch events, visually enhanced to highlight new entries and key information within each epoch (Strategy, Capital, Cognition). Could use subtle animations for new entries.
    - **Recent Activity/Audit Log Snippets:** A feed of recent mesh activity or snippets from the audit log, visually distinct and potentially filterable.
    - **Port Audit:** Component displaying port status, visually represented (e.g., color-coded indicators).
    - **Mesh Hydration Audit:** Component showing hydration status with clear visual cues.

- **Domain Overview (Optional Carousel):**
    - **Domain Cards:** A carousel or grid of cards representing different mesh domains. Each card should display key information (name, modules, status) with visual indicators for status and potentially a mini-chart or icon representing domain health or activity. Cards could have subtle hover effects and transitions on click.

## AI Visualization Concepts

The Mesh Dashboard will visualize the activity and insights of the self-improving AI throughout the interface:

- **Global AI Status Indicator:** A small, persistent icon or indicator (perhaps in the top bar or sidebar) showing the AI's operational status (Active, Analyzing, Idle, Warning). Could have subtle pulsing or animation when active.
- **AI-Generated Insights Widgets:** Dedicated sections or components (like the Intelligence Map and Forecasts) will prominently display AI-generated analysis, predictions, and recommendations. These should be visually distinct and highlight the AI's contribution.
- **Real-time Analysis Indicators:** When the AI is actively analyzing data for a specific component or section, a visual indicator (e.g., a subtle spinner, a changing icon, or a progress bar within the relevant component) will be displayed.
- **Rationale and Confidence Levels:** Where applicable, AI-generated rationales or confidence levels for predictions should be clearly and visually presented, perhaps using tooltips, expandable sections, or visual scales.
- **AI-Triggered Events Visualization:** Visualize events triggered by the AI (e.g., autonomous overrides, resource reallocations) in relevant sections or a dedicated activity stream, with clear labeling and visual cues indicating AI action.

## Navigation Integration

The Dashboard page is the default view upon successful login. It is linked as the primary item in the persistent sidebar navigation. Clicking the "Dashboard" link in the sidebar will always return the user to this overview page.

## Notes for Visual Design and Interactivity

To achieve a "perfect presetive 2025" look and encourage "addictive visuals":

- **Define a Strong Visual Identity:** Develop a unique and consistent color palette, typography scale, and iconography style that reflects the strategist-grade, data-focused, and secure nature of the mesh. Aim for a clean, modern aesthetic with clear visual hierarchy.
- **Micro-interactions and Animations:** Implement subtle animations for data updates, transitions between states (loading, error, success), hover effects, and clicks. These should be smooth, performant, and provide positive feedback.
- **Dynamic Data Visualization:** Go beyond static charts. Implement interactive charts with zooming, filtering, and drill-down capabilities. Explore alternative visualizations like chord diagrams for relationships, heatmaps for density, or custom components for unique mesh data representations.
- **Real-time Updates:** Ensure data streams and metrics update in near real-time with smooth transitions, giving the user a sense of a live, dynamic system.
- **Conditional Styling:** Use conditional styling to highlight critical information, anomalies, or status changes with clear visual cues (e.g., color changes, pulsating effects).
- **Gamification Elements (Subtle):** Consider subtle elements that reward user interaction or successful mesh operations, encouraging engagement (e.g., visual confirmation on successful actions, progress indicators for long-running tasks).
- **Dark Mode First:** Design with a dark mode as the primary aesthetic, as it often aligns with data-heavy interfaces and can reduce eye strain during prolonged use.
- **Focus on Data Storytelling:** Design the visualizations and data presentation to tell a clear story about the mesh's health, performance, and AI insights, guiding the user to key conclusions.
