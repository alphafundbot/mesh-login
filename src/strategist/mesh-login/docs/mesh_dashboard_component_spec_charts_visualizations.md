# Mesh Dashboard Component Specification: Charts and Data Visualizations

## Purpose and Usage

Charts and data visualization components are essential for transforming complex mesh data into understandable and actionable insights. They are used to visualize trends over time, show relationships between different data points, display distributions, and highlight anomalies or critical events across various modules (e.g., resource utilization, financial metrics, security events, AI predictions).

## Visual Appearance

- **Color Palettes:** Define a strategist-grade color palette specifically for data series in charts. Ensure sufficient contrast between different series. Use distinct semantic colors for highlighting critical data points, anomalies (e.g., destructive/warning colors), or positive trends. The palette should be consistent across all chart types.
- **Typography:** Use the defined strategist-grade typography for chart labels, axes, tooltips, and legends. Font sizes should be legible at various dashboard scales and responsiveness levels.
- **Grid Lines and Axes Styling:** Grid lines and axes should be subtle to avoid visual clutter but provide necessary context. Use a consistent style (color, weight, dash pattern) across all charts. Axes labels should be clear and concise.
- **Tooltips:** Design informative and visually appealing tooltips that appear on hover, displaying detailed data points and relevant context. Tooltip styling (background, border, typography) should be consistent with the overall design language.
- **Legends:** Clearly label data series using the defined typography and color palette. Legend placement should be consistent where possible (e.g., above or below the chart).

## Types of Charts

Specify common chart types and their recommended usage:

- **Line Charts:** Ideal for visualizing trends over time (e.g., revenue growth, resource utilization, security event frequency).
- **Bar Charts:** Useful for comparing discrete categories or showing distributions (e.g., resource allocation by module, number of events by severity).
- **Radar Charts:** Suitable for visualizing multi-dimensional data and comparing performance across different metrics or categories (e.g., domain stability, security, and activity).
- **Area Charts:** Similar to line charts, but emphasize the volume of change over time.
- **Heatmaps:** Effective for showing data density or relationships between two variables (e.g., activity intensity by time of day and module).
- **Custom Visualizations:** Allow for the creation of bespoke visualizations for specific mesh concepts (e.g., network topology map, anomaly propagation visualization).

## States

- **Default:** Standard presentation of the chart with loaded data.
- **Loading:** Display a clear loading indicator or skeleton state while data is being fetched.
- **Empty:** Show a clear message or visual representation when there is no data to display.
- **Error:** Display a prominent error message if data fetching or rendering fails.
- **Interactive:** Define visual responses for hover (tooltips, highlighting), active selections (clicking on data points), and other interactions (zooming, filtering).

## Responsiveness

Charts and visualizations must be responsive, adapting to different container sizes and screen dimensions. This may involve:

- Adjusting chart dimensions (width, height).
- Adapting axis label density or orientation.
- Hiding or aggregating less critical information on smaller screens.
- Providing tooltips or alternative methods for accessing detailed data on touch devices.

## Accessibility

Ensure charts and visualizations are accessible:

- Use sufficient color contrast for data series, labels, and other elements.
- Provide alternative text descriptions for complex visualizations for screen reader users.
- Ensure keyboard navigation and focus states are clear for interactive elements.
- Consider providing data in tabular format as an alternative to visualizations.

## Notes for Visual Engagement

- **Animations:** Incorporate subtle animations for data updates, chart rendering (e.g., gradual drawing of lines or bars), and transitions between states. Animations should be smooth and non-disruptive.
- **Interactive Filtering/Zooming:** Implement interactive controls (sliders, brushes, zoom) that allow users to explore specific data ranges or filter data directly within the chart.
- **Highlighting:** Visually highlight key data points, anomalies, or thresholds using distinct colors, markers, or animations.
- **Micro-interactions:** Add subtle micro-interactions (e.g., on hover over data points) that provide immediate feedback and reinforce the user's interaction with the data.
- **Real-time Updates:** For live data streams (like the Omega Epoch Stream), implement real-time updating visualizations with subtle visual cues to indicate new data points.
- **Storytelling through Data:** Design visualizations that effectively tell the story of the mesh's state, trends, and AI insights, making the data compelling and understandable.
