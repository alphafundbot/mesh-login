# Mesh Project High-Level Architectural Overview

This document provides a high-level, text-based overview of the Mesh project's architecture, outlining key modules, their interactions, external service integrations, and infrastructure components.

## Key Modules

*   **Destine-root (Python Container):** Core operational control, system checks, override trigger initiation.
*   **MeshDashboard (Node.js/TypeScript Container):** User Interface for monitoring, management, and interaction.
*   **Firebase-proxy (Node.js/TypeScript Container):** Backend logic for interacting with Firebase services and potentially external APIs (like Gemini).
*   **Audit-engine (Python Container):** Performs system audits, compliance checks, and generates audit logs.
*   **Autonomous Resource Manager (Planned - TypeScript/Node.js Module/Container):** Monitors resource utilization, analyzes optimization opportunities, and manages resource allocation.
*   **Data Monetization Module (Conceptual):** Secure aggregation, analysis, and anonymization of data for external monetization.
*   **Autonomous Trading Agent (Conceptual):** Executes autonomous trades based on mesh intelligence.
*   **IAMControlPanel (Planned - within MeshDashboard):** User interface for managing Identity and Access Management.

## Data Flow and Interactions

*   **MeshDashboard <--> Firebase-proxy:** MeshDashboard interacts with Firebase-proxy via internal API calls (e.g., for fetching data, triggering backend actions).
*   **MeshDashboard <--> Firebase (Auth, Firestore):** MeshDashboard (client-side) interacts directly with Firebase Authentication for user login/session management and Firestore for real-time data updates (with security rules enforced).
*   **Destine-root <--> Firebase (Firestore):** Destine-root likely reads/writes operational data and triggers in Firestore.
*   **Audit-engine <--> Firebase (Firestore):** Audit-engine likely writes audit logs to Firestore and potentially reads configuration/data.
*   **Firebase-proxy <--> External APIs (Gemini):** Firebase-proxy makes requests to external APIs.
*   **Autonomous Resource Manager <--> Infrastructure Components:** Resource Manager interacts with underlying infrastructure (e.g., Docker API, Cloud Provider APIs) to monitor and manage resources.
*   **Autonomous Resource Manager <--> Firebase (Firestore/Database):** Resource Manager might store resource metrics or optimization decisions in a database.
*   **Modules <--> Logging/Monitoring System:** All modules should send logs and metrics to a centralized logging and monitoring system.
*   **Modules <--> Message Queue/Event Bus (Conceptual):** For asynchronous communication and decoupling (e.g., Destine-root triggering Audit-engine, Resource Manager notifying other modules).

## External Service Integrations

*   **Firebase:** Authentication, Firestore (primary database), potentially others (Storage, Cloud Functions).
*   **Google Secret Manager:** Used by Firebase-proxy (and potentially other modules) for securely storing sensitive keys (e.g., Gemini API key).
*   **Gemini API:** Integrated via Firebase-proxy for AI capabilities.
*   **Planned Financial Integrations (Stripe, Metamask, SoFi):** Conceptual integrations for automated revenue generation.
*   **Planned Telecom Integrations:** Conceptual integrations for secure communication services.
*   **Cloudflare / GoDaddy:** External services for domain management and potentially security/performance.

## Infrastructure Components

*   **Docker Containers:** Each module is intended to run within its own Docker container for isolation and portability.
*   **Docker Compose:** Orchestrates the deployment and networking of the containers (defining the `meshnet`).
*   **Databases (Firestore):** Primary data storage. Other databases might be introduced for specific needs.
*   **Logging/Monitoring System:** Centralized system for collecting and analyzing logs and metrics.
*   **Message Queue/Event Bus (Conceptual):** For inter-module communication.
*   **Cloud Provider Infrastructure (GCP assumed):** Virtual machines, networking, managed services hosting the containers and databases.

## Security Boundaries and Interaction Points

*   **Container Boundaries:** Isolation between modules provided by containerization.
*   **Network Boundaries (`meshnet`):** Controlled communication between containers.
*   **API Endpoints:** Interaction points for MeshDashboard with backend modules (need authentication/authorization).
*   **Database Security Rules:** Enforced access control for data in Firestore.
*   **Secret Management:** Secure handling of API keys and credentials via Secret Manager.
*   **External Service APIs:** Integration points with external services (require secure authentication and authorization).
*   **User Authentication/Authorization (Firebase Auth, `src/lib/roles.ts`):** Controls user access to MeshDashboard functionalities and data.
*   **Inter-Module Authentication/Authorization (Conceptual):** Mechanisms to secure communication and interactions between backend modules.

This overview provides a structural lens for understanding the mesh. The next steps involve applying AI-driven analysis to refine and optimize this architecture for extreme performance, security, and autonomous capabilities.
