# Mesh Dashboard Wireframe: Audit Log Details Page

**Page Title:** Audit Log Entry: [Log ID]

**Overall Layout:**

- Main content area within the standard `AppLayout` (likely with a sidebar navigation).
- Page title at the top of the main content area.
- Content organized into key sections using Cards or similar visual containers.

**Key Sections and Content Arrangement:**

1.  **Overview/Summary (Card):**
    -   **Card Title:** Summary
    -   **Card Content:**
        -   Log ID (prominently displayed)
        -   Timestamp (Date and Time)
        -   Severity Level (e.g., Info, Warning, Error, Critical - visually distinct)
        -   Action Performed (Brief description)
        -   Status (e.g., Success, Failed)

2.  **Event Details (Card):**
    -   **Card Title:** Event Details
    -   **Card Content:**
        -   Detailed description of the event.
        -   Event type or code.
        -   Raw log data (potentially in a collapsible or scrollable code block).

3.  **User Information (Card):**
    -   **Card Title:** User Information
    -   **Card Content:**
        -   User ID or Identifier.
        -   User Role (if available).
        -   Originating IP Address.

4.  **Resource Affected (Card):**
    -   **Card Title:** Resource Affected
    -   **Card Content:**
        -   Type of Resource (e.g., Container, Module, API Endpoint, Database).
        -   Resource Identifier (Name, ID, or Endpoint).
        -   Link to Resource Details page (if applicable and user has permission).

5.  **Context/Metadata (Card):**
    -   **Card Title:** Context and Metadata
    -   **Card Content:**
        -   Relevant metadata associated with the log entry (e.g., request parameters, response codes, system state at the time of the event).
        -   Structured data presented clearly (e.g., key-value pairs, formatted JSON).

**Integration of Components:**

-   `Card` for section containers.
-   Typography elements (headings, paragraphs, labels) for text.
-   Lists or definition lists for presenting key-value pairs within sections.
-   Code block component for displaying raw log data.

**Visualization of Related Events or Trends (Optional Section):**

-   If applicable, a section (potentially another Card) visualizing related audit events or trends around this specific log entry (e.g., a timeline of events for the affected resource, a chart showing frequency of this event type).

**Notes for Visual Design and Interactivity:**

-   Use color coding for log severity to immediately draw attention to critical entries.
-   Design a clear visual hierarchy within each section to make key details easily scannable.
-   Implement collapsible sections for less critical or raw data to manage complexity.
-   Ensure readability of raw log data within the code block (syntax highlighting if possible).
-   Consider micro-interactions on hover for elements like user IDs or resource identifiers to reveal more information.
-   Provide clear links to related detail pages (User, Resource) where appropriate and based on user permissions.
