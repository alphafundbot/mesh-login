# Data Visualization Elements Specification

## Purpose and Usage

This document specifies the design and behavior of fundamental data visualization elements used within charts and graphs across the MeshDashboard. These elements (Tooltips, Legends, and Axes) are crucial for helping users understand the data being presented, providing context, and enabling interaction.

## Tooltip Specification

- **Purpose:** To display detailed information about a specific data point when the user hovers over or focuses on it within a chart.
- **Visual Appearance:**
    - **Shape:** Rounded corners, subtle border.
    - **Background:** Opaque background color (e.g., `hsl(var(--card))`) with a subtle shadow.
    - **Border:** Thin border color (e.g., `hsl(var(--border))`).
    - **Typography:** Clear, readable typography for data labels and values (aligning with the strategist-grade typography scale).
    - **Colors:** Use appropriate text colors for labels and data values, potentially using semantic colors for highlighting (e.g., positive/negative trends).
    - **Spacing:** Adequate internal padding around content.
- **States:**
    - **Visible:** Appears on hover or focus.
    - **Hidden:** Disappears when not hovered or focused.
- **Responsiveness:** Should adapt positioning to remain visible within the chart area on different screen sizes.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure sufficient color contrast for text, provide keyboard navigation support for focus states.
- **Integration:** Receives data from the chart based on the hovered/focused data point.
- **Notes for Visual Engagement:** Subtle fade-in/fade-out animation on appearance/dismissal. Clear visual connection (e.g., a small pointer) to the hovered data point.

## Legend Specification

- **Purpose:** To identify the data series or categories displayed in a chart and their corresponding visual representations (e.g., colors, symbols).
- **Visual Appearance:**
    - **Layout:** Can be displayed horizontally or vertically, depending on chart size and available space.
    - **Typography:** Clear typography for legend labels (aligning with the strategist-grade typography scale).
    - **Colors:** Each legend item should display the color or symbol corresponding to its data series, aligning with the chart's color palette.
    - **Spacing:** Adequate spacing between legend items.
- **States:**
    - **Default:** Displays all legend items.
    - **Active/Inactive:** Legend items might have interactive states (e.g., clickable) to toggle the visibility of data series in the chart. Active items could be visually highlighted.
- **Responsiveness:** Should adapt layout (horizontal/vertical) based on available space.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure sufficient color contrast for labels and symbols, provide keyboard navigation support if interactive.
- **Integration:** Receives data series information from the chart.
- **Notes for Visual Engagement:** Subtle animation on toggling data series visibility.

## Axes Specification

- **Purpose:** To provide scales and labels for the data plotted on a chart (e.g., time, values, categories).
- **Visual Appearance:**
    - **Lines:** Clean, subtle lines for axes and grid lines (e.g., `hsl(var(--border))`).
    - **Typography:** Clear typography for axis labels and tick values (aligning with the strategist-grade typography scale, potentially smaller than body text).
    - **Colors:** Axis lines and labels in a neutral color (e.g., `hsl(var(--muted-foreground))`).
    - **Spacing:** Adequate spacing for labels and tick marks to prevent overlap.
- **States:**
    - **Default:** Displays standard axes and labels.
    - **Interactive:** Axes might support zooming or panning (if implemented), with visual feedback on the current view range.
- **Responsiveness:** Should adapt label density and formatting based on chart size to prevent overlap.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure sufficient color contrast for labels, consider providing data tables as an alternative for users who cannot easily interpret charts.
- **Integration:** Receives data ranges and categories from the chart data.
- **Notes for Visual Engagement:** Subtle transitions on axis scale changes during zooming or data updates.
