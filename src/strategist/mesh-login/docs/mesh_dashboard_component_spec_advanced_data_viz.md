# Advanced Data Visualization Component Specifications

## Purpose and Usage

This document outlines the specifications for advanced data visualization components used in the Mesh Dashboard. These components are designed to present complex data relationships, distributions, and patterns in highly interactive and visually engaging ways, enabling strategists to gain deeper insights into mesh operations, performance, and anomalies. The goal is to move beyond basic charts to visualizations that facilitate exploration and understanding of multi-dimensional data.

## Visual Appearance

Advanced data visualizations should adhere strictly to the strategist-grade design language.

-   **Color Palettes:** Utilize carefully selected and consistent color palettes for different data series, categories, or heat intensity. Ensure palettes are accessible and convey meaning effectively.
-   **Typography:** Apply the defined typography scale for labels, tooltips, legends, and annotations within the visualizations. Ensure readability against varying backgrounds.
-   **Styling:** Define specific styling for visual elements within each chart type (e.g., segment borders in Pie Charts, point shapes/sizes in Scatter Plots, cell borders/gradients in Heatmaps).
-   **Interactivity Indicators:** Design clear visual indicators for interactive states (e.g., hover effects on data points or segments, focus states, selection highlights).
-   **Annotations and Callouts:** Specify styling for annotations, callouts, or labels that highlight specific data points or trends.

## Types of Charts and Visualizations

Specify the visual appearance, usage, and data mapping for various advanced visualization types:

-   **Pie/Donut Charts:**
    -   **Usage:** Displaying proportions of a whole.
    -   **Visuals:** Segment colors from the defined palette, clear labels with percentages or values, optional donut hole for central information.
    -   **Data Mapping:** Requires data with categories and corresponding numerical values.
-   **Scatter Plots:**
    -   **Usage:** Visualizing relationships between two numerical variables, identifying clusters or outliers.
    -   **Visuals:** Point shapes and colors based on data attributes, clear axes, optional trend lines.
    -   **Data Mapping:** Requires data with at least two numerical dimensions per point.
-   **Heatmaps:**
    -   **Usage:** Displaying the magnitude of a phenomenon as color in two dimensions, revealing patterns and correlations.
    -   **Visuals:** Color gradients from the defined palette representing intensity, clear axis labels.
    -   **Data Mapping:** Requires data with values mapped to a 2D grid.
-   **Network Graphs:**
    -   **Usage:** Visualizing relationships and connections between entities (e.g., modules, resources, users).
    -   **Visuals:** Node shapes, sizes, and colors based on attributes, edge thickness and color representing relationship strength/type.
    -   **Data Mapping:** Requires data defining nodes and edges.
-   **Custom Visualizations:**
    -   **Usage:** For unique data structures or insights that require specialized visual representation (e.g., timeline visualizations, dependency graphs).
    -   **Visuals:** Define custom styling and interactive elements as needed, adhering to the overall design language.

## Data Mapping

Clearly define the expected data structure (e.g., array of objects, specific key-value pairs) for each visualization type to ensure seamless integration with data sources.

## States

Define the visual appearance for different states:

-   **Default:** The standard visual representation of the visualization.
-   **Loading:** Display a skeleton or loading indicator while data is being fetched.
-   **Empty:** Display a clear message or visual indicator when there is no data to display.
-   **Error:** Display an error message or visual indicator if data fetching or rendering fails.
-   **Interactive States:** Define specific visual feedback for hover (e.g., highlighting elements, displaying tooltips), selection, and filtering.

## Responsiveness

Visualizations must be responsive and adapt gracefully to different container sizes and screen dimensions.

-   **Scaling:** Charts and elements should scale appropriately while maintaining readability.
-   **Adaptation:** Consider simplifying complex visualizations or providing alternative views on smaller screens.
-   **Tooltip Positioning:** Ensure tooltips are positioned correctly and remain visible on various devices.

## Accessibility

Ensure advanced data visualizations are accessible to users with disabilities:

-   **Color Contrast:** Maintain sufficient color contrast for all visual elements, including data points, lines, labels, and backgrounds.
-   **Alternative Text:** Provide alternative text descriptions for complex visualizations for screen reader users.
-   **Keyboard Navigation:** Ensure interactive elements within visualizations are navigable and operable with a keyboard.
-   **Tooltip Accessibility:** Ensure tooltips are accessible via keyboard and screen readers.

## Notes for Visual Engagement

Advanced data visualizations should be highly engaging to encourage exploration and "doom scrolling" in a positive, informative context:

-   **Animations:** Incorporate subtle and purposeful animations for data updates, state changes, and transitions between views.
-   **Tooltips:** Design rich and informative tooltips that appear on hover, providing detailed data points and context.
-   **Highlighting:** Implement visual highlighting for key data points, trends, or anomalies (potentially driven by AI insights).
-   **Interactive Exploration:** Design interactive features like zooming, panning, filtering, and drilling down into data directly within the visualization.
-   **Real-time Updates:** Where applicable, visualize real-time data updates with subtle animations to convey the dynamic nature of the mesh.
