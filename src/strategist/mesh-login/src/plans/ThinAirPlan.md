# Thin Air Business Plan

## 1. Ephemeral Module Lifecycle

This section outlines the principles and processes governing the lifecycle of ephemeral modules within the Mesh. Ephemeral modules are designed for specific, often transient tasks, invoked as needed and dissolved upon completion.

**Key Considerations:**

*   **Instantiation:** How are ephemeral modules brought into existence? What triggers their creation (e.g., strategist invocation, anomaly detection, scheduled task)?
*   **Resource Allocation:** How are resources (compute, memory, network) allocated to ephemeral modules? How is quota managed for these temporary entities?
*   **Execution and Monitoring:** How is the execution of ephemeral modules monitored? What telemetry is collected? How are their outputs handled?
*   **Dissolution:** How are ephemeral modules gracefully terminated and their resources reclaimed? What are the triggers for dissolution (e.g., task completion, timeout, error)?
*   **State Management:** How is the state of ephemeral modules managed during their lifecycle? Is state persisted, and if so, where and how?

## 2. Anomaly Detection Heuristics

This section details the heuristics and methods used by Thin Air to detect anomalies within the Mesh, particularly focusing on silent drift and unexpected behavior in ephemeral modules and invocation flows.

**Key Considerations:**

*   **Signal Monitoring:** What signals are monitored for anomaly detection (e.g., invocation latency, resource usage spikes, unexpected module behavior, deviation from baseline)?
*   **Heuristic Design:** What specific heuristics are employed (e.g., statistical analysis, pattern recognition, rule-based detection)? How are these heuristics defined and updated?
*   **Thresholds and Baselines:** How are anomaly detection thresholds determined and adjusted? How are normal operating baselines established?
*   **False Positives/Negatives:** How are false positives and negatives minimized? Is there a feedback mechanism for refining heuristics?
*   **Integration with Anomaly Scan Quadrant:** How are detected anomalies fed into the Anomaly Scan quadrant of the MeshAuditDashboard for visualization and strategist awareness?

## 3. Invocation Bootstrap Logic

This section describes the logic and processes involved in bootstrapping the invocation of modules, particularly focusing on how Thin Air initiates ephemeral modules and handles invocation requests from various sources.

**Key Considerations:**

*   **Invocation Triggers:** What events or signals trigger module invocation (e.g., strategist command, API call, internal mesh event, external webhook)?
*   **Module Resolution:** How is the target module for an invocation request identified and located? How are cross-domain invocations handled?
*   **Parameter Passing:** How are parameters and context passed to invoked modules?
*   **Error Handling:** How are errors during the bootstrap process handled? How are invocation failures reported?
*   **Integration with MPC and Router:** How does the invocation bootstrap logic interact with the MPC for orchestration and the Router for path mapping?
*   **Cold Starts:** How are cold starts for ephemeral modules managed to minimize latency?
